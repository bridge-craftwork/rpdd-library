//! The narrow arithmetic must produce exactly the deals the wide arithmetic did.
//!
//! `reproduces_the_library.rs` is the check that matters, but it can only see
//! the 81,920 deals the fixture has digests for. This one holds a second,
//! deliberately naive generator — the `u128` unranking the 32-bit limbs and the
//! `u64` tail replaced — and compares it deal for deal over a million or so,
//! from starts scattered through the library including its last group.
//!
//! It is `#[ignore]`d because it takes about two seconds in release and
//! considerably longer in debug, and because it is a regression guard rather
//! than a fact about the library:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --release -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! Keep it if the unranking is touched again. The reference below is the
//! shipping code of commit 74d2407, transcribed unchanged; both it and the
//! crate came from `docs/xxdd-disassembly.asm`, so agreeing with it is evidence
//! the narrowing preserved the algorithm, not evidence about the constants.

/// The generator as it stood before the 32-bit limbs: every step in `u128`.
