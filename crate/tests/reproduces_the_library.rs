//! The generator reproduces Pavlicek's deals, or it is worthless.
//!
//! Nothing about a wrong constant fails loudly. A transposed step or a mistyped
//! multiplier still yields four thirteen-card hands, and every one of them is a
//! legal deal — just not his, which would silently pair every deal with another
//! deal's double-dummy table. So the check is against digests taken from the
//! real 241MB library, one per 16,384-deal seed group, scattered through the
//! file and including the first group and the last.
//!
//! The deals themselves are not committed. Publishing a few hundred thousand of
//! them to test against would be publishing the very thing this crate exists to
//! make unnecessary.
