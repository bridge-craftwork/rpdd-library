//! The deals of Richard Pavlicek's solved-deal library, from their index.
//!
//! His `rpdd.zip` ships the double-dummy results (`rpdd.zdd`) together with
//! `xxdd.exe`, a 2,560-byte program that recreates the deals those results
//! belong to. Only the results are data: the deals are a pure function of their
//! index, and his own documentation says as much — making them "was easy", and
//! the two years of computer time went on solving them.
//!
//! This crate is that function, ported from the program. It has no
//! dependencies and knows nothing about tables: an index goes in, a packed deal
//! comes out, and pairing it with a table is the caller's business.
//!
//! # Seeking is cheap
//!
//! The generator re-seeds every 16,384 deals from the group index, so deal N
//! costs at most 16,383 deals of catch-up rather than replaying from zero. At
//! roughly 640ns a deal that is about 10ms for the worst case, which is what
//! makes an arbitrary starting position practical. A wasm32 build costs about
//! the same: the unranking is deliberately written in arithmetic that target
//! has natively.
//!
//! ```
//! use rpdd_deals::Deals;
//!
//! // Anywhere in the library, without generating what comes before it.
//! let mut deals = Deals::from(4_096_000);
//! let packed = deals.next().expect("the library is 10,485,760 deals long");
//! assert_eq!(packed.len(), 13);
//! ```
//!
//! # The packed form
//!
//! Thirteen bytes, two bits per card, holding the seat: `00` West, `01` North,
//! `10` East, `11` South. Card order is SA, SK, ... S2, then the same
//! descending run for hearts, diamonds and clubs; bits are numbered least
//! significant first. That is the deal half of a `.zrd` record exactly, so it
//! can be handed straight to a decoder for that format.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Recovered from `xxdd.exe` by disassembly. `docs/xxdd-disassembly.asm` in
//! this repository is the annotated listing every constant below came from, and
//! `docs/reference-implementation.py` is a Python transcription kept beside it.
//! Do not "clean up" a constant without checking it there: they are not
//! arbitrary, and nothing about a wrong one fails loudly — it simply produces
//! deals that are not his.
